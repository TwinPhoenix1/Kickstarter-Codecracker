As the name suggests - this is a web app that predicts with 80%+ confidence whether your Kickstarter project will be successful - entirely based on factors you can control.

The app uses a dataset of 25k+ Kickstarter projects, on which it builds its predictive model. Download the dataset [from here]([https://pages.github.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffh8hKTIZgS3-cGkowuCPfC9I1AkgHFq/view?usp=drive_link)) and paste it into the folder with all other repository files. You can then safely run the app.
